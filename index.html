                      The Sirens are mythological Greek monsters who lure passing sailors to their deaths with their beckoning voices and singing. Before they became monsters, however, the first three Sirens,
                      Peisinoe, Aglaope and Thelxiepeia, were the daughters of the river god <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Achelous</a> and the muse <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Melpomene</a>. T
                      hese three were the handmaidens of <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Persephone</a>,
                      the daughter of <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Zeus</a> and <a href="" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Demeter</a>, who was abducted by <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Hades</a>
                      when he lured her away with flowers, and she wandered off too far.
                      Not knowing Persephone’s whereabouts in the
                      underworld, the sirens prayed to Demeter to assist in the search for her daughter. Agreeingly,
                      Demeter transformed their appearances into those of <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Ba-Birds</a>, allowing them to pass into the
                      underworld. However, before Persephone could be found, she ate 6 pomegranate seeds from the
                      underworld, binding her there, and forcing her to spend six months every year with Hades. Demeter,
                      furious that her daughter was taken from her for half of each year, punished the Sirens for not
                      keeping closer watch over her daughter. She kept them in their half-bird form and cursed them to die,
                      should any mortal hear their enchanting singing and escape the temptation that follows. Demeter then
                      banished them to an island in between Italy and Sicily, which would be called Sirenum Scopuli, or
                      Siren Rock.

                  <p class="main__container--paragraph">
                      Throughout the Siren’s exile upon the island many sailors came near them, where they would succumb to the Sirens song and were lured to them and eaten.
                      Occasionally, the Sirens would seduce and have children with some of the lured sailors and increase the number of sirens on the island. When <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Jason and
                      the Argonauts</a> came to the waters of Sirenum Scopuli the Sirens burst out in singing, but before their voices to entice the sailors, Jason commanded the
                      skillful musician, Orpheus, to play his music as loudly as possible. Orpheus’ music drowned out the Sirens tempting singing and all but one sailor named
                      Butes managed to pass the Sirens unharmed and since the mortals didn’t hear the Sirens song, their prophecy wasn’t fufilled. The next hero who came to Siren
                      Rock was <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Odysseus</a> on his voyage to return to Ithaca. <a  href="#" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: white">Circe</a> warned him of the enticing voices of the Sirens and when Odysseus was nearing the Sirens, he ordered
                      his crew to fill their ears with candle wax to block the sounds. Odysseus, being curious also ordered his crew to tie him to the mast of the ship so he could hear
                      the Sirens’ singing and not fall victim to their song. When the crew came upon the island, two sirens, Aglaope and Thelxiepeia sang out to them but the wax worked
                      and the crew rowed on. Odysseus heard their song of promised wisdom and begged his crew to let him swim to the Sirens, but the crew only bound him tighter and once
                      they were out of earshot of the Sirens released him. Since Odysseus heard the Sirens song and escaped them, Aglaope and Thelxiepeia plunged into the ocean and drowned
                      themselves fulfilling Demeter’s curse. Over the next hundreds of centuries, the Sirens lured countless sailors to their doom with their song. Some of the Sirens’ had
                      children with river and sea gods, making their descendants half human half fish, the first mermaids. And these mermaids along with the Sirens continued to lure mortals
                      with the sweetness of their song for all of eternity.

                      until he heard the honeyed voices pouring from our lips, and once he hears to his hearts
                      content sails on, a wiser man. We know all the pains that the Greeks and Trojans once endured on
                      spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so—all that comes to pass on the fertile earth,

                      The Sirens eventual development into villains was the impact of their punishment from Demeter, as they failed to watch over Persephone.
                      They were cursed to have bird-like appendages, and if any passing sailors passed by them
                      unharmed, they were to kill themselves or face death. Therefore, they had no choice but to
                      abide by the rules of their fate and deceive sailors to bring them to death, or to lure them
                      in to use as food or for reproduction. They otherwise would not have survived and were basically
                      forced into a position of evil.

                      Overall, the sirens were not cast out by the gods, but rather their fate was shaped by the myths and legends that surround them. Their stories often serve as cautionary tales about the dangers of temptation and the consequences of succumbing to one's desires

                      Sirens are a hybrid between a woman and a bird. They are described as winged creatures who have beautiful human-like faces and voices;
                      but possess a monstrous lower half like the Minotaur, because their bottom consists of a bird's body and claws. Siren's gender could be either female or bird based on these descriptions,
                      therefore making their pronouns She/Bird.

                  <p>
                      There are no exact dimensions of this monster,
                      but using pixel extrapolation and what stories have said about Odysseus and Sirens, an approximate can be made.
                      Odysseus in Madeline Miller's, novel <span style="text-decoration: underline">Circe</span>, is described as someone
                      "not so tall as others" who has "short legs [that] [are] deceptive" (Pg 196, 290). Based on this, he is probably 5'7 or roughly 170CM.

                  <p>
                      To calculate the dimensions of a Siren, an image of them along with Odysseus was printed and measured to determine their height. I multiplied their measurements by 39x, the scale, to get their dimensions. <br><br> Siren Width: ~205CM <br> Siren Height: ~91CM
